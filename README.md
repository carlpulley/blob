##Â Blob Example

### Assumptions:

  * it is not necessary to parse a formatted text file into an internal 'blob' representation

### Design Notes

The left, right, top and bottom values define a square that represents the current known boundaries of our blob pattern.
This algorithm operates by growing that square by (randomly) choosing new cells outside the currently known blob
boundaries. When no more cells may be chosen, then we know the boundaries of our blob.

This implementation will function with arbitrarily large rectangular grids.

## Build Instructions

First ensure that Java and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) are installed.

To compile:

    sbt compile

To run tests (which includes the supplied example grid):

    sbt test
